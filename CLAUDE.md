# Resume Coach

## Purpose

This repository is your **single source of truth** for professional experience, education, certifications, and skills. It serves four goals:

1. **Structured record-keeping** — all experience data lives here in markdown, versioned with git
2. **Targeted resume generation** — produce ad-hoc resumes tailored to specific roles or opportunities
3. **Interview preparation** — practice recruiter screenings and hiring manager interviews with AI coaching
4. **Professional self-awareness** — coaching-derived insights on identity, values, strengths, and narrative patterns that inform how everything above gets written

## Owner Profile

Owner details live in `data/profile.md` (gitignored — prevents personal data leaking on public forks).

**Always read `data/profile.md` at the start of any session that generates CVs, coaching, or personalised output.**

## Data Files — Conventions

### IMPORTANT: Content Exclusions for CVs/Resumes

**`data/project-background/` folder contents must NEVER be used in CVs, resumes, or any client-facing materials.**

This folder contains sensitive background information (legal disputes, project failures, internal assessments) that:
- Is for internal reference and risk assessment only
- Must not appear in professional marketing materials
- Should not be mentioned in interviews unless specifically asked
- Serves as institutional knowledge for career planning and decision-making

When generating resumes or preparing interview materials, **completely ignore** all files in `data/project-background/`.

### Projects (`data/projects/*.md`)

Each project file follows a consistent structure with these fields: **Period**, **Role**, **Client**, **Industry**, **Location**, **Type**, then sections for **Description**, **Responsibilities**, **Key Achievements**, **Technologies**, and **Tags**. See `framework/templates/project.md` for the full field list including optional fields.

**Type values:** `flagship` | `consulting` | `contract` | `employment` | `co-founded` | `internship` | `side-project`. A `flagship` is the candidate's single most significant role or project — typically multi-year, high-impact, and central to their professional identity. Not every candidate has one, and that's normal. Not every candidate has a flagship — it's optional.

### Skills (`data/skills.md`)

Skills are grouped by category with experience levels. Keep this updated as new projects add skills.

### Certifications (`data/certifications.md`)

Include status: active, renewal pending, or expired. Include exam codes.

### Companies (`data/companies.md`) *(optional)*

Own business entities with founding dates, purposes, and outcomes. Only relevant for candidates with entrepreneurial or freelance backgrounds. These are not client projects — they provide context for ventures or business arrangements relevant to the candidate's career.

## Resume Generation

See `framework/resume-workflow.md` — read this file before generating any resume. It contains the full workflow (11 steps), tailoring rules, CV quality standards, and the mandatory pre-output checklist.

## Interview Training

See `framework/interview-workflow.md` — read this file before running any coaching session. It contains the session workflow, coaching rules, and progress logging requirements.

### Answering Strategies

Six quick-reference strategy files in `framework/answering-strategies/` provide in-call techniques for recruiter screenings. Each file has a Quick Overview section for fast scanning before interviews:

1. **[behavioral-questions-without-prepared-example.md](framework/answering-strategies/behavioral-questions-without-prepared-example.md)** — The Blank Mind Protocol: what to do when asked "Tell me about a time..." and you can't recall specifics (4 paths: specific example, pattern answer, honest pivot, clarifying question)
2. **[gap-reframing.md](framework/answering-strategies/gap-reframing.md)** — How to address missing skills, experience, or certifications without disqualifying yourself (acknowledge → pivot → question back)
3. **[pin-down-defense.md](framework/answering-strategies/pin-down-defense.md)** — How to handle pressure tests when recruiter restates your gap as a closed fact ("So you don't have X then")
4. **[question-back-technique.md](framework/answering-strategies/question-back-technique.md)** — How to turn questions around strategically to reveal real requirements and buy thinking time
5. **[anti-patterns.md](framework/answering-strategies/anti-patterns.md)** — What NOT to do: 60-second pre-call checklist of common mistakes (volunteering negatives, over-explaining, essay structure, etc.)
6. **[direct-answer-structure.md](framework/answering-strategies/direct-answer-structure.md)** — How to structure answers properly: Answer first → Brief context → Stop (fixes "essay structure" pattern)

**Pre-interview review:** Scan anti-patterns.md (60 seconds) and the Quick Overview sections of relevant strategy files before any recruiter call.

### Voice Simulation Workflow

For voice-based practice, three skills work together:

1. **`/voice-export <cv-path> <job-ad-url>`** — generates a self-contained recruiter simulation prompt for the Claude App (voice mode). No coaching in voice — just a realistic call.
2. *(User practises in the Claude App, then pastes transcript back here)*
3. **`/debrief <cv-path>`** — analyzes the transcript against coached answers, identifies anti-patterns, and logs the session to progress tracking.

## Working With This Repo

- **First-time setup:** Run `/import-cv` with a CV file path or paste text. Extracts structured data into `data/` files. Can be run repeatedly — old CV first, new CV later, data merges automatically.
- **Discovering professional identity:** Run `/extract-identity` for a guided coaching conversation that produces `data/professional-identity.md` — strengths, growth edges, narrative patterns, values.
- **Adding new experience:** Create a new project file in `data/projects/` (copy `framework/templates/project.md`), add an entry to `data/project-index.md`, and update `data/skills.md` if new skills were used
- **Updating existing data:** Edit the relevant file in `data/`
- **Generating a resume:** Provide a job description or role requirements, and ask for a targeted resume
- **Practising for interviews:** Provide a job description and ask for a recruiter screening or mock interview session
- **Fleshing out projects:** After importing, many project files will have TODO sections marking areas that need more detail from your memory — fill these in for better CV generation and coaching
- **Scanning job boards:** Run `/scan-jobs` with a portal domain (e.g. upwork.com) and optional search terms to find matching projects with fit scoring
- **Updating professional identity:** After coaching sessions or moments of professional reflection, update `data/professional-identity.md` with new insights

## Tools & Environment

**Setup (optional — only needed for PDF features):** Python 3.8+, then `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**PDF generation:**
```bash
python tools/md_to_pdf.py <input.md> [output.pdf]
```

**PDF text extraction** (processes all PDFs in `files/`):
```bash
python tools/convert_pdfs.py
```

## Style Guidelines

See `framework/style-guidelines.md` — covers tone, language conventions, and market-specific CV format options.
