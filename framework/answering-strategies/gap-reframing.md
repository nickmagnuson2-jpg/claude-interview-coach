# Gap Reframing — Handling Missing Experience/Skills

## What Is Gap Reframing?

When the recruiter asks about experience/skills you don't have, **gap reframing** is the technique of:
1. Acknowledging the gap honestly
2. Pivoting to adjacent/transferable strengths
3. Making it about outcomes (what the client needs) instead of checkboxes (what you lack)

This is NOT lying or dodging — it's helping the recruiter understand whether the gap actually matters.

---

## Quick Overview

**What it is:** A technique for addressing missing experience, skills, or certifications without disqualifying yourself.

**How to apply:** "[Acknowledge gap]. [Pivot to adjacent strength]. [Question back or outcome framing]."

**Example:**
> **Recruiter:** "Do you have Terraform experience?"
>
> **You:** "Not Terraform specifically, but I manage [N] environments end-to-end with [your IaC tool]. Since both are Infrastructure as Code, the thinking is the same. Does the client need Terraform specifically, or IaC experience?"

**Why this works:**
- ✓ Honest about the gap (no sneaking past filters)
- ✓ Shows what you DO have that's related
- ✓ Reframes requirement (tool vs. outcome)
- ✓ Helps recruiter understand if gap actually matters

**When to use:** Whenever recruiter asks about experience, skills, certifications, or domain knowledge you don't have.

**Critical rule:** Never volunteer gaps. Only reframe what they explicitly ask about.

---

## Why This Works

Recruiters are checkbox-matching. But they often don't know whether a checkbox is a **hard requirement** (must-have) or a **nice-to-have** (client will accept alternatives).

Your job is to help them understand:
- What you DO have that's related
- Whether that's sufficient for the client's actual needs

If you can do the job, the specific tool/tech/industry often doesn't matter.

## The Wrong Responses

### ❌ Denying the Gap
> "Well, I've worked with Angular which is basically the same as React..."

**Why this fails:** You sound like you're trying to sneak past the filter.

### ❌ Apologizing for the Gap
> "I'm sorry, I don't have that. I wish I did..."

**Why this fails:** Apologizing makes the gap sound like a dealbreaker.

### ❌ Over-Explaining Why the Gap Exists
> "I didn't have the opportunity to work with React because my team used Angular, and by the time React became popular..."

**Why this fails:** Recruiter doesn't care why. They care whether you can do the job.

### ❌ Saying "Not Really" or "No"
> Recruiter: "Do you have React experience?"
> You: "Not really, no."

**Why this fails:** This is the worst possible answer. You just disqualified yourself with zero attempt to reframe. (This is the most damaging anti-pattern — track it in your anti-pattern scorecard.)

## The Correct Response Pattern

### Formula

> "[Acknowledge gap]. [Pivot to adjacent strength]. [Question back or outcome framing]."

### Structure

1. **Acknowledge the gap** — Be honest, don't apologize
2. **Pivot to what you DO have** — Adjacent skill, transferable experience, or relevant outcome
3. **Reframe to outcomes or question back** — Make it about their needs, not your resume

## Gap Reframing by Type

### Type 1: Specific Technology/Tool Gap

**Pattern:** "Not [X] specifically, but I [adjacent tech]. [Outcome you deliver]."

**Examples:**

| Gap | Reframe |
|-----|---------|
| No [framework B] | "Not [framework B] specifically, but I've built production apps with [framework A] for 4+ years — same patterns, same tooling ecosystem. Does the client need [framework B] specifically, or someone productive in [domain]?" |
| No [tool B] | "Not [tool B], but I manage [N] environments end-to-end with [tool A]. Since both solve the same problem, the thinking transfers. Does the client need [tool B] specifically, or [capability] experience?" |
| No [specific product] | "Not extensively, but I've solved the same underlying problem at [your project] — [concrete examples]. Is the client looking for someone who knows [product], or someone who delivers [outcome]?" |

**Key:** Acknowledge → Pivot to adjacent → Question back

---

### Type 2: Certification Gap

**Pattern:** "Certification [status], but the practical experience the cert validates, [evidence]."

**Examples:**

| Gap | Reframe |
|-----|---------|
| [Cert X] expired | "[Status]. Renewal planned for [date]. [Active related certs] are current until [year]. And the practical experience the cert validates — like [concrete project work from your data] — doesn't expire. Is the certification a hard client requirement?" |
| No [DevOps cert] | "Not certified yet, but I have [N]+ [CI/CD platform] pipelines in production and the practical experience the cert validates. Does the client need the certification, or DevOps experience?" |
| No PMP | "Not PMP-certified, but I've managed projects for [N]+ years. Is that a client requirement, or is it about project management experience?" |

**Key:** Status → Practical experience → Question if cert is hard requirement

---

### Type 3: Industry/Domain Gap

**Pattern:** "Not [industry] specifically, but I [transferable domain experience]. [Outcome framing]."

**Examples:**

| Gap | Reframe |
|-----|---------|
| No FinTech | **EN:** "Not FinTech directly, but I've worked in regulated industries — healthcare, energy — with compliance requirements and audit trails. Does the role need FinTech domain knowledge, or experience in regulated environments?" |
| | **DE:** "Nicht direkt FinTech, aber ich habe in regulierten Branchen gearbeitet — Gesundheitswesen, Energie — mit Compliance-Anforderungen und Audit-Trails. Braucht die Rolle FinTech-Domänenwissen, oder Erfahrung in regulierten Umgebungen?" |
| No Retail | **EN:** "Not retail, but I've built high-volume customer-facing platforms. Does the client need retail domain knowledge, or experience with transaction-heavy systems?" |
| | **DE:** "Nicht direkt Retail, aber ich habe hochvolumige, kundenorientierte Plattformen gebaut. Braucht der Kunde Retail-Domänenwissen, oder Erfahrung mit transaktionsintensiven Systemen?" |
| No Manufacturing | **EN:** "Not manufacturing directly, but I've integrated IoT devices with backend systems — real-time data processing, device management, monitoring. Does the role need manufacturing expertise, or IoT integration experience?" |
| | **DE:** "Nicht direkt Manufacturing, aber ich habe IoT-Geräte mit Backend-Systemen integriert — Echtzeit-Datenverarbeitung, Gerätemanagement, Monitoring. Braucht die Rolle Manufacturing-Expertise, oder IoT-Integrationserfahrung?" |

**Key:** Adjacent domain → Transferable skills → Question if domain knowledge is required

---

### Type 4: Missing "Nice-to-Have" from Job Ad

**Pattern:** Ignore it in your pitch, address it only if asked.

**Template:**

Job ad says: "Nice to have: [nice-to-have tool/skill]"

**If asked — technology-neutral pattern:**
> "[Nice-to-have tool] I haven't used in production, but I've worked extensively with [your related tools in the same domain]. Does the client need [tool] specifically, or [broader capability]?"

**Filled example — Azure integration stack:**

Job ad says: "Nice to have: Experience with Azure Logic Apps"

**EN:**
> "Azure Logic Apps I haven't used in production, but I've worked with event-driven architectures for years — Azure Functions, Service Bus, and similar integration patterns. Does the client need Logic Apps specifically, or event-based integration experience?"

**DE:**
> "Azure Logic Apps habe ich noch nicht produktiv eingesetzt, aber ich arbeite seit Jahren mit event-driven Architekturen — Azure Functions, Service Bus und ähnlichen Integrationsmustern. Braucht der Kunde Logic Apps konkret, oder event-basierte Integrationserfahrung?"

**If NOT asked:**
Don't bring it up. Recruiters forget half the nice-to-haves. Only address gaps they explicitly probe.

---

### Type 5: Timeline/Recency Gap

**Pattern:** "[Time since last use], but [what you remember / why it's still relevant]."

**Examples:**

| Gap | Reframe |
|-----|---------|
| "Your [technology X] experience is from [year]" | "Last direct work was [year], but the fundamentals — [core skills that transfer] — haven't changed. And I currently work with [related modern technology]. Does the client need cutting-edge [X] features, or solid [domain] experience?" |
| "No recent [language Y]" | "Last used [Y] in production in [year], but I've been a [your primary language] developer for [N]+ years — the concepts transfer. Does the client need [Y] experience, or an experienced backend developer who ramps up quickly?" |

**Key:** Acknowledge recency → Core skills still valid → Question if cutting-edge knowledge is needed

## Real-World Examples from Coaching Sessions

As you practise with `/debrief` and coaching sessions, strong reframes get saved to `coaching/coached-answers.md`. Below is the structure of a good example — replace the placeholders with your own after sessions.

### Example Structure

**Recruiter:** "[Question probing a gap in your experience]"

**Your reframe:**
> "[Honest acknowledgement]. [Pivot to constituent skills you DO have]. [Question-back that reframes the requirement]."

**What makes it work:**
- ✅ Honest about the gap (no pretending)
- ✅ Pivots to adjacent skills the role actually needs
- ✅ Question-back reframes the requirement (tooling vs. outcome, specific product vs. underlying skill)
- ✅ Confident framing — states what you *have* done, not what you haven't

**Scoring:** After each session, rate your reframes 1-5 and save the best ones to `coaching/coached-answers.md` for reuse.

## Common Mistake: Over-Reframing

### ❌ Reframing a Non-Gap

**Bad:**
> Recruiter: "I see you have [N] years of [language] experience."
> You: "Yes, and while I don't have [other language], [language] and [other language] are very similar..."

**Why this fails:** You just volunteered a negative. They didn't ask about [other language].

**Good:**
> Recruiter: "I see you have [N] years of [language] experience."
> You: "Correct, [N]+ years, with the last [M] years focused on [your primary platform/domain]."

**Rule:** Only reframe gaps they explicitly ask about. Never volunteer a gap.

## When Gap Reframing Doesn't Work

### Hard Requirements You Can't Reframe

Some gaps are genuinely disqualifying:
- Job requires German, you don't speak German
- Job requires active security clearance, you don't have it
- Job requires on-site presence 5 days/week, you're in another country

**In these cases:**
> "No, I don't. Is that a hard requirement or is there flexibility?"

Don't try to reframe the un-reframable. Just ask if it's negotiable.

## Practice Exercise

For each gap in your profile:
1. What's the gap?
2. What's the adjacent strength?
3. What's the outcome framing or question-back?

Add these to your cheat sheets for quick reference during calls.

---

## Key Principles

1. **Acknowledge the gap honestly** — Don't apologize, don't deny
2. **Pivot to what you DO have** — Adjacent skill, transferable experience, outcome
3. **Make it about their needs** — Not "I lack X" but "Do you need X or Y?"
4. **One reframe, then stop** — Don't over-explain
5. **Confident, not defensive** — You're helping them clarify requirements
