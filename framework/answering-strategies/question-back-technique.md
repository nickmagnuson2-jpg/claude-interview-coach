# Question-Back Technique — Turn Questions Around

## What Is a Question-Back?

A **question-back** is when you answer a recruiter's question, then immediately ask a related question that:
1. Buys you thinking time
2. Narrows the scope of what they're asking
3. Reveals whether a concern actually matters
4. Turns potential objections into collaborative problem-solving

---

## Quick Overview

**What it is:** Answer the recruiter's question, then immediately ask a related question that reveals their real requirement or turns concern into collaboration.

**How to apply:** Always answer FIRST, then question back. Never use it to dodge.

**Examples:**

**After stating rate:**
> **Freelance:** "My rate is [amount]. **Is that within budget?**"
> **Permanent:** "My salary expectation is [amount]. **Does that fit the range for this role?**"
> **DE:** "Mein Stundensatz liegt bei [XXX] Euro. **Liegt das im Budget?**"

**After gap question:**
> "Not GraphQL specifically, but I've built REST APIs for 5+ years with complex data querying. **Does the client need GraphQL expertise, or strong API design experience?**"

**When closing:**
> "That sounds like a very good match. I'm very interested. **What does the process look like from here?**"
> **DE:** "Das klingt nach einem sehr guten Match. Ich bin sehr interessiert. **Wie sieht der weitere Prozess aus?**"

**Why this works:**
- ✓ Buys you 20-30 seconds while they answer
- ✓ Reveals real requirements vs. job ad checkboxes
- ✓ Shows strategic thinking and engagement
- ✓ Shifts from defense to collaboration
- ✓ Gives you control of conversation direction

**When to use:** After gap questions, after stating rate, after complex explanations, when closing, or when narrowing broad questions.

## Why This Works

Recruiters expect you to ask questions. It's a sign of engagement, not evasion.

A well-placed question-back:
- ✅ **Shows you're thinking strategically** (not just answering mechanically)
- ✅ **Gives you control** of the conversation direction
- ✅ **Buys you 20-30 seconds** while they answer
- ✅ **Reveals the real requirement** (vs. what's written in the job ad)
- ✅ **Turns concerns into needs** you can address

## When to Use Question-Backs

### 1. **After Answering a Gap/Weakness Question**

**Pattern:** Answer → context → question back

**Example:**
> "Not [X] directly, but I [adjacent experience that's genuinely close — be specific]. **Does the client need [X] specifically, or someone with [broader skill you have]?**"

**Why:** Reframes the gap as a clarification of their actual need.

---

### 2. **After a Broad Behavioral Question (narrows scope = easier recall)**

**Pattern:** Buy thinking time → ask for clarification → narrower question makes recall easier

**Example:**
> Recruiter: "Tell me about a time when you disagreed with someone on a technical decision."
> You: "Do you mean a situation within the team, or with the client?"
> **DE:** "Meinen Sie eine Situation im Team oder mit dem Kunden?"
> Recruiter: "Within the team."
> You: [Now searching a smaller memory space -- easier to recall specific example]

**Why:**
- Buys you 20-30 seconds while they clarify
- **Narrows the scope, which makes recall MUCH easier** — "disagreement" (too broad) becomes "team disagreement" (specific)
- Shows engagement

**Key insight:** Having a more specific situation to recall makes it easier to find a concrete example in your memory.

### 3. **After Stating Your Rate**

**Pattern:** State rate → question back

**Example:**
> **Freelance:** "My rate is [amount]. **Is that within budget?**"
> **Permanent:** "My salary expectation is [amount]. **Does that fit the range for this role?**"
> **DE:** "Mein Stundensatz liegt bei [XXX] Euro. **Liegt das im Budget?**"

**Why:**
- Shifts burden to them (they tell you if it's a problem)
- Opens rate negotiation if needed
- Shows confidence (you're not apologizing for your rate)

---

### 4. **After Explaining a Complex Situation (e.g., Concurrent Engagements)**

**Pattern:** Explain how you manage it → question back about their specific concern

**Example:**
> "[Explain your setup — how you handle the situation concretely, referencing real precedents from your projects]. **Are there critical phases in this project where the client needs dedicated availability? Then we can plan around those specifically.**"

**Why:**
- Acknowledges the concern
- Shows you've thought about it
- Turns abstract worry into concrete planning

---

### 5. **When You Suspect the Written Requirement Isn't the Real Requirement**

**Pattern:** Answer what they asked → question back to reveal actual need

**Example:**
> "Not Terraform specifically, but I've managed infrastructure as code with [your IaC tool] for 3+ years. **Does the client need Terraform expertise, or IaC experience in general?**"

**Why:** Many job ads list tools when they actually need outcomes. The question-back reveals this.

---

### 6. **When Closing the Call**

**Pattern:** Express interest → question back about next steps

**Example:**
> "[Brief statement connecting your core strength to the role]. I'm very interested. **What does the next step in the process look like?**"

**Why:**
- Shows engagement
- Gets you tactical information (timeline, next steps, what to prepare)
- Ends the call on your initiative, not theirs

## Question-Back Formulas by Situation

### Rate Questions

| Situation | Question-Back |
|-----------|---------------|
| After stating rate | "Is that within the budget?" |
| After rate pushback | "Is the engagement for the full [duration]? Then we can discuss the range." |
| When they say rate is high | "What does the budget look like? Then I can tell you if it works." |

### Gap/Weakness Questions

| Situation | Question-Back |
|-----------|---------------|
| Missing specific tech | "Does the client need [X] specifically, or is [adjacent skill] sufficient?" |
| Cert expired/missing | "Is that certification a hard requirement from the client?" |
| No industry experience | "Does the role require [domain] expertise, or [transferable skill] experience?" |

### Availability/Logistics Questions

| Situation | Question-Back |
|-----------|---------------|
| Concurrent engagement concern | "Are there critical phases in the project where the client needs dedicated availability?" |
| Remote work concern | "Does the client expect regular on-site presence, or is it fully remote?" |
| Start date | "Is [start date] fixed, or is there flexibility?" |

### Closing Questions

| Situation | Question-Back |
|-----------|---------------|
| After expressing interest | "What does the next step look like — is there a technical interview with the client?" |
| When unsure about fit | "Is there anything specific you'd like me to highlight in my profile?" |
| Multiple candidates | "How many profiles are you presenting to the client?" |

*Adapt these to the conversation language. For non-English calls, translate naturally — e.g. German: "Liegt das im Budget?", "Braucht der Kunde [X] speziell?"*

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Question-Back Without Answering First

**Bad:**
> Recruiter: "Do you have Kubernetes experience?"
> You: "Does the client need K8s specifically?"

**Why this fails:** Sounds evasive. You dodged the question.

**Good:**
> Recruiter: "Do you have Kubernetes experience?"
> You: "Not K8s specifically, but Docker in production for 5+ years. Does the client need K8s expertise, or containerization experience?"

---

### ❌ Too Many Question-Backs in a Row

**Bad:**
> You: "Is that within the budget? And is it for six months? And is there flexibility on the rate?"

**Why this fails:** You're interrogating the recruiter. One question-back per answer.

**Good:**
> You: "[Amount]. Is that within the budget?"
> Recruiter: "That's at the upper end."
> You: "Is the engagement for the full six months from the start? Then we can discuss the range."

**DE version:**
> You: "[XXX] Euro. Liegt das im Budget?"
> Recruiter: "Das ist am oberen Ende."
> You: "Geht es um die vollen sechs Monate ab Start? Dann können wir über die Spanne sprechen."

---

### ❌ Question-Back That Sounds Defensive

**Bad:**
> "Why do they even need [specific experience] if it's just [dismissive simplification]?"

**Why this fails:** Sounds like you're challenging the requirement.

**Good:**
> "Does the client need [specific experience], or [broader capability that covers the real need]?"

## Practice Exercise

For each common recruiter question, prepare:
1. Your answer
2. A question-back that reveals the real requirement or turns concern into collaboration

Add these to your cheat sheets.

## Building Your Own Examples

As you practise (via coaching sessions or `/debrief`), strong question-back moments get saved to `coaching/coached-answers.md`. Review those for real examples that worked in your voice — they're more useful than generic templates.

## Key Principles

1. **Always answer first, then question back** — Never use question-back to dodge
2. **One question-back per answer** — Don't interrogate
3. **Make it about their needs, not your gaps** — Frame as clarification, not defense
4. **Stop talking after the question** — Let them answer
5. **Confident, not defensive** — You're helping them clarify, not challenging them
