# Anti-Patterns — What NOT to Do

## Quick Overview

**What this is:** A consolidated checklist of common mistakes to avoid in recruiter calls.

**When to use:** Review this in 60 seconds before any recruiter call as a negative checklist.

**Purpose:** These patterns damage trust, create disqualifiers, or waste the recruiter's time. Remembering them prevents backsliding.

---

## Pre-Call Checklist (60 Seconds)

Before any recruiter call, remind yourself:

- ❌ Don't volunteer negatives they didn't ask about
- ❌ Don't explain how things work to the recruiter
- ❌ Don't give verdict last (answer directly, then explain)
- ❌ Don't apologize for gaps (reframe instead)
- ❌ Don't say "not really" or "no, I haven't" (always reframe)
- ❌ Don't confirm their concerns (question back instead)
- ❌ Don't ramble or over-explain (answer → brief context → stop)

---

## The One Recruiter Rule

Before answering any recruiter question, silently ask: **"What checkbox are they trying to tick right now?"** Then tick it in 1-2 sentences. Stop talking. The silence is the recruiter's problem, not yours.

## The Meta-Insight

**You treat recruiter calls like hiring manager conversations.** You over-explain, add personal context, and chat — instead of ticking boxes. This is the root cause of most recruiter-stage mistakes below. Recruiters don't evaluate depth — they filter. Give them what they need to forward you.

---

## Anti-Patterns by Category

### **1. Volunteering Negatives**

**What it is:** Bringing up gaps, weaknesses, or concerns that the recruiter didn't ask about.

**Why it's bad:** Creates disqualifiers out of thin air. The recruiter has a list of things to check — don't add to it.

**Examples:**

❌ "I have 12 years of C++ experience, though I haven't worked with Java..."
- They didn't ask about Java. Don't volunteer it.

❌ "I can start April 1st, though I also have a concurrent engagement..."
- They asked about start date. The concurrent engagement is a separate concern — only address if they probe.

❌ "The [Cert A] is active, though the [Cert B] is missing..."
- They asked about [Cert A]. Don't volunteer missing certs.

**Instead:** Only address what they explicitly ask. If they don't ask, it doesn't exist in this conversation.

**Not this anti-pattern:** When the recruiter asks directly about something you don't have ("Do you have Java experience?"), acknowledging the gap is expected -- that's gap-reframing, not volunteering. See #10 for how the acknowledgment itself can go wrong.

---

### **2. Over-Explaining / Lecturing the Recruiter**

**What it is:** Explaining technical concepts, industry context, or how things work when the recruiter didn't ask.

**Why it's bad:** Wastes time, sounds condescending, shows you don't understand recruiter calls are checkbox filters.

**Examples:**

❌ "Let me explain how GraphQL works and why my REST API experience translates..."
- They're checking a box, not learning API architecture from you.

❌ "You have to understand that [complex topic] is really nuanced because [technical explanation]..."
- They don't need to understand. They need to know if you can do the job.

❌ "The certification is technically valid for three years from passing, and they extend them if you recertify within 6 months..."
- Just say when it expires and when you're renewing.

**Instead:** Answer the question. One or two sentences of context maximum, then stop.

---

### **3. Essay Structure (Verdict Last)**

**What it is:** Giving a long preamble or explanation before answering the actual question. The answer comes at the end, not the beginning.

**Why it's bad:** Recruiter gets impatient waiting for your answer. If you ramble long enough, they assume the answer is "no."

**Examples:**

❌ "Well, [specific process] is interesting because you have to rebuild in the target environment, and there are different approaches depending on the workload type... so technically no, but I've done something similar..."
- Start with the answer, not the theory.

❌ "TypeScript is really just JavaScript with types, and I've been doing JavaScript for 5 years, so the concepts are the same... I haven't used TypeScript specifically."
- Verdict first: "Not TypeScript specifically, but JavaScript for 5+ years."

**Instead:** Answer first, brief context second. See [direct-answer-structure.md](direct-answer-structure.md).

---

### **4. Not Answering the Actual Question**

**What it is:** Giving a tangential or philosophical answer instead of the concrete example or direct answer they asked for.

**Why it's bad:** Forces the recruiter to ask again. If they ask twice and you still don't answer, trust damage.

**Examples:**

❌ **Q:** "Tell me about a time you disagreed with a technical decision."
❌ **A:** "At the end of the day, I make recommendations and the client decides..."
- They asked for a story, not your consulting philosophy.

❌ **Q:** "Have you done [specific process]?"
❌ **A:** "I understand the client's requirements around zero downtime and parallel environments..."
- Just answer: "Not in that exact form, but I've done parallel environment buildouts with zero downtime."

**Instead:** Listen to what they're asking for (story? yes/no? number?) and give them that. See [behavioral-questions-without-prepared-example.md](behavioral-questions-without-prepared-example.md) for STAR storytelling.

---

### **5. Apologizing Instead of Reframing**

**What it is:** Saying "sorry" or expressing regret when asked about a gap.

**Why it's bad:** Makes the gap sound like a dealbreaker. Apologizing signals you think it's disqualifying.

**Examples:**

❌ "I'm sorry, I don't have TypeScript experience."
- Never apologize for a gap.

❌ "Unfortunately I haven't worked in financial services..."
- "Unfortunately" has the same effect as apologizing.

**Instead:** Acknowledge → Pivot → Reframe. See [gap-reframing.md](gap-reframing.md).

✓ "Not TypeScript specifically, but JavaScript in production for 5+ years with strict linting. Does the client need TypeScript, or strong JavaScript with type discipline?"

---

### **6. Confirming the Recruiter's Concern**

**What it is:** Agreeing with a negative framing or concern the recruiter raises.

**Why it's bad:** You just gave them a written disqualifier. They can't forward you if you confirm the problem.

**Examples:**

❌ **Recruiter:** "So you don't have Kubernetes experience then."
❌ **You:** "That's right, I don't."
- You just confirmed the gap is a blocker.

❌ **Recruiter:** "So running a concurrent engagement could be an issue."
❌ **You:** "Yeah, it could be challenging..."
- Don't confirm the concern. Defuse it.

**Instead:** Pin-down defense. See [pin-down-defense.md](pin-down-defense.md).

✓ "Not MongoDB specifically, but PostgreSQL for 6+ years including JSON document storage and full-text search. Does the client need MongoDB specifically, or NoSQL-capable database experience?"

---

### **7. Undermining Your Own Argument**

**What it is:** Making contradictory statements within the same answer or within 60 seconds.

**Why it's bad:** Damages credibility. Shows confused thinking or lack of conviction.

**Examples:**

❌ "I can definitely handle 60-70 hours... though realistically 40 hours is my target."
- Which is it? 60-70 or 40?

❌ "The system is fully autonomous... but I need to be available for incidents."
- Is it autonomous or not?

**Instead:** Decide your narrative before you speak. Don't qualify your own claims within the same breath.

---

### **8. Defensive Analogies**

**What it is:** Using emotional comparisons to justify a concern instead of addressing it factually.

**Why it's bad:** Sounds defensive and doesn't actually defuse the concern.

**Examples:**

❌ "If my wife were in the hospital, would I be at work or would I be there? Same with incidents."
- This analogy makes the recruiter MORE worried, not less.

**Instead:** Address the concern with facts and architecture. Use concrete operational details (redundancy, failover, uptime history) rather than emotional analogies.

---

### **9. Hedging or Waffling on Rate, Availability, or Logistics**

**What it is:** Showing uncertainty about your rate, availability, or logistics when asked.

**Why it's bad:** Signals lack of confidence. Makes the recruiter think you'll fold in negotiations.

**Examples:**

❌ "I usually charge around... I mean, it depends on the project, but maybe 120... or we could discuss..."
- Just state the rate.

❌ "I think I could start April 1st, probably, unless..."
- Yes or no. If there's a condition, state it clearly.

❌ "Well... I guess three days on-site is ok..."
- "I guess" is not a commitment. The recruiter can't write "candidate confirmed on-site."

❌ "I could maybe do hybrid, it depends on the week..."
- Vague. State what you CAN do, then ask about flexibility.

**Instead:** Direct statement → Question back.

✓ **Freelance:** "My rate is [amount]. Is that within budget?" / **DE:** "Mein Stundensatz liegt bei [XXX] Euro. Liegt das im Budget?"
✓ **Permanent:** "My salary expectation is [amount]. Does that fit the range?"
✓ "I'm available from [date]. Does that work with the project timeline?"
✓ "I'm based in Berlin, so three days on-site works. Is the team flexible on which days?"
✓ "My preference is two days, but I can do three. Is there flexibility?"

---

### **10. Saying "Not Really" or "No, I Haven't" / Heavy Negative Openers**

**What it is:** Giving a flat negative when asked about a skill or experience, with no reframe. Also: opening with a heavy negative statement that becomes the headline even when a pivot follows.

**Why it's bad:** A standalone negative disqualifies you with zero attempt to show adjacent strengths. A heavy negative opener ("I have no X experience in production") lands hard enough to become what the recruiter writes down, even if your pivot afterward is strong.

**Examples:**

❌ **Recruiter:** "Do you have Terraform experience?"
❌ **You:** "Not really, no."
- Flat negative, no pivot. You just ended the conversation.

❌ **Recruiter:** "Walk me through your Java experience."
❌ **You:** "While I have no Java experience in production, I have..."
- The pivot follows, but "no Java experience in production" is a full sentence that lands as the headline. The recruiter writes down the negative, not the pivot.

**Instead:** ALWAYS reframe. See [gap-reframing.md](gap-reframing.md).

✓ "Not Terraform specifically, but I manage [N] environments with [your IaC tool]. Does the client need Terraform specifically, or IaC experience?"

**Where gap-reframing is NOT this anti-pattern:** When the recruiter asks directly, a minimal acknowledgment followed by an immediate pivot is correct technique:

✓ "Not [X] specifically, but I [adjacent strength]." -- speed bump, not a wall. The pivot is the headline.
✓ Skipping the negative entirely and leading with what you have -- also fine.

**The test:** Would the recruiter's notes say "no X experience" (anti-pattern) or "has Y and Z, not X specifically" (gap-reframing)? If your negative is a standalone sentence or the longest part of your answer, it's this anti-pattern. If it's a half-second clause before a concrete pivot, it's clean.

---

### **11. Missing the Recruiter's Actual Question**

**What it is:** Answering a different question than what was asked because you didn't listen carefully.

**Why it's bad:** Wastes time. Shows you're not listening. Forces them to ask again.

**Examples:**

❌ **Recruiter:** "When can you start?"
❌ **You:** "I'm very interested in this project because..."
- They asked for a date, not your interest level.

❌ **Recruiter:** "What's your rate?"
❌ **You:** "Well, it depends on the scope and duration..."
- Just give the number.

**Instead:** Listen to the question type (yes/no? date? number? story?) and give that specific thing.

**Note:** Overlaps significantly with #4 — both stem from not matching your answer type to the question type.

---

### **12. Generic Self-Description (No Differentiator)**

**What it is:** Introducing yourself with buzzwords or generic role titles instead of a memorable differentiator.

**Why it's bad:** You sound like every other candidate. Nothing memorable for the recruiter to forward to the client.

**Examples:**

❌ "I'm a senior cloud architect and backend developer with experience in migrations..."
- Generic. Describes 100 candidates.

**Instead:** Lead with your unique differentiator — what makes you different from others with the same job title. See `data/professional-identity.md`.

✓ "I'm a [Role] specialising in [your domain] — for the last [N] years I've [your most impressive scope or impact, from your projects]."

Alternative differentiator templates (choose the one that fits your story):
- **Depth:** "I'm a [Role] — I've spent the last [N] years going deep on [specific domain], most recently [flagship achievement]."
- **Breadth:** "I'm a [Role] who bridges [area A] and [area B] — at [project], I [concrete cross-cutting achievement]."
- **Impact:** "I'm a [Role] — the systems I've built [measurable outcome: serve N users / process N transactions / run in N markets]."

---

### **13. Getting Stuck on Buzzword/Umbrella Terms**

**What it is:** Hesitating or asking the recruiter to define a term you can't precisely define (e.g. "cloud-native architecture", "DevOps culture").

**Why it's bad:** The recruiter can't define it either. Asking creates an awkward silence that sounds like you don't know the topic.

**Instead:** Don't define the term. List the concrete things you do that fall under the umbrella — e.g. "SOA, distributed services, serverless functions, message queues, IaC, CI/CD" — and let the term attach itself. **Prep:** Scan the job ad before the call and look up any term you can't define in one sentence. 30 seconds of prep prevents a 30-second hesitation.

---

### **14. Not Answering Both Meanings of an Ambiguous Term**

**What it is:** Getting tripped up by terms where the recruiter could mean two different things (e.g. "DevOps" = Azure DevOps the product OR DevOps practices; "Salesforce" = Sales Cloud the CRM OR the Salesforce platform/ecosystem).

**Why it's bad:** If you ask "which do you mean?", the recruiter probably doesn't know the difference. You lose momentum.

**Instead:** If you do BOTH meanings, answer for both in two sentences. Examples:
- **Azure DevOps:** "[Product name] is my daily platform — [feature list]. And [practice name] as a discipline is my daily work: [practice list]." Both boxes ticked.
- **Salesforce:** "I've configured Sales Cloud for [use case]. And I've built custom apps on the Salesforce platform with [Apex/Lightning/Flows]." Both interpretations covered.

---

### **15. Missing Quantitative Checkboxes**

**What it is:** Giving a qualitative answer when the recruiter asks for a number (e.g. "at least 5 years of [technology]?" / **DE:** "mindestens 5 Jahre [Technologie]?").

**Why it's bad:** The recruiter needs to write a number on their checklist. "Yes, extensive experience" doesn't tick the box.

**Instead:** Say the number. Then stop.

---

### **16. Firm Without Framing**

**What it is:** Holding your position on rate, salary, or conditions without giving the recruiter reasons to justify it internally.

**Why it's bad:** The recruiter is your advocate inside the process. If you say "110k, take it or leave it" they can't go to the hiring manager and explain why. You sound stubborn instead of valuable.

**Examples:**

❌ "No. 110 would be good."
- Held the number (good), but gave zero justification. The recruiter has nothing to write.

❌ "That's my rate. It's non-negotiable."
- Firm, but adversarial. The recruiter stops advocating for you.

**Instead:** Hold your position + brief justification + question back.

✓ "I understand that's the upper end. For what I bring — [2-3 concrete differentiators] — I think that's where I should land. Is there flexibility in the package beyond base?"
✓ "My rate is [amount]. That reflects [scope/certs/experience]. Is that within budget?"

**Key:** The recruiter isn't your opponent. They need ammunition to fight for you internally. Give it to them.

## How to Use This List

**Before a call (60 seconds):**
1. Scan the Pre-Call Checklist at the top
2. Remind yourself of the top 3: Don't volunteer negatives, don't explain/lecture, answer first (not verdict last)

**After a call:**
- Review: Did I trigger any of these?
- If yes, note which one and how to avoid it next time

**In coaching sessions:**
- These are tracked in `coaching/anti-pattern-tracker.md` and per-session scorecards
- Goal is to see counts plateau, then drop to zero
