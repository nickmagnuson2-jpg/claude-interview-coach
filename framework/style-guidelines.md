# Style Guidelines

## Tone & Voice

Derive the CV's tone from the candidate's data files — don't assume a default persona.

Before writing, read:
- `data/professional-identity.md` — identity statements, strengths, and narrative patterns define how the candidate should sound (e.g. hands-on builder vs. strategic advisor vs. consultative leader)
- `data/profile.md` — location and language context inform spelling variant and market conventions

Then apply these universal principles:
- **Professional but not stiff** — match the energy of the candidate's identity, not a generic corporate template
- **Use the narrative patterns table** — if `professional-identity.md` contains reframes, apply them. The candidate's default framing is usually weaker than the coached version
- **Use concrete numbers** where the source data provides them (scale, duration, team size, impact metrics)
- **Language variant:** Infer from `data/profile.md` location or match the job posting's language. Maintain consistency within a single CV. Match the formality level expected in the target market's language conventions (e.g. German resumes use formal professional German)
- **Never impose a work-style assumption** (e.g. "hands-on", "building and operating", "consulting on") — let the projects and identity data speak for themselves

## CV Formats

> The format to use is determined by the target market from the job posting or `data/profile.md`. Regional formats below cover market-specific conventions. When in doubt, use the International format.

### International CV Format (default)

For international roles, direct applications, or when no regional format matches:
- Professional summary at the top (tailored)
- If the candidate has an anchor project (type: `flagship`), highlight it prominently. Otherwise, lead with the 2-3 most relevant projects for the target role
- Skills grouped thematically, not just listed
- Projects can be reordered by relevance rather than strictly chronological
- Education and certifications can be positioned for maximum impact

### US Resume Format

For US-based roles and US job boards:
- Professional summary at the top (tailored, concise)
- No photo, no date of birth, no personal details beyond name/contact/LinkedIn
- Experience section with accomplishment-driven bullets (lead with impact metrics)
- Education at the bottom (unless recent graduate)
- Typically 1-2 pages (senior roles may extend to 3)
- No availability or rate in the document — discuss in conversation

### UK CV Format

For UK-based roles:
- Personal statement / professional summary at the top
- No photo (unless creative industry)
- Experience section with achievement-oriented bullets
- Education section (include A-levels/GCSEs only for junior candidates)
- Typically 2 pages
- "References available on request" is optional and increasingly omitted

### DACH Freelancer Profil

For the DACH freelance market (platforms like freelance.de, GULP, Hays, etc.):
- Header: Name, title, contact, photo placeholder, availability, daily/hourly rate
- Certificates section near the top
- Skills as a table (skill + years)
- Projects listed reverse-chronologically with: period, role title, client/industry, bullet points, technologies
- Education at the bottom
- No professional summary (or very brief)
- Date and location at the bottom ("[City], [date]")
