# Job Application Pipeline

Track job applications through a stage-based pipeline with auto-generated action items per stage transition.

## Arguments

- `$ARGUMENTS`: Optional. If empty, show the current pipeline summary.
  - `add <company> <role> [url]` — add a new application
  - `update <company> <new-stage>` — advance an application to a new stage
  - `remove <company>` — remove/archive an application

Examples:
- `/job-pipeline` — show pipeline summary and what needs attention
- `/job-pipeline add Stripe "Senior PM"` — add new application at Researching stage
- `/job-pipeline add Notion "Product Manager" https://notion.so/careers/pm` — add with URL
- `/job-pipeline update Stripe "Phone Screen"` — advance Stripe to Phone Screen
- `/job-pipeline remove Stripe` — archive the Stripe application

## Data File

All pipeline data lives in `data/job-pipeline.md`.

## Instructions

### Command: Show Pipeline (no arguments)

1. Read `data/job-pipeline.md`.
2. If the file is empty or has no entries, display a welcome message:
   ```
   Pipeline is empty. Add your first application:
     /job-pipeline add <company> <role> [url]

   Stages: Researching → Applied → Phone Screen → Interview → Offer → Accepted/Rejected/Withdrawn
   ```
3. If entries exist, display:
   - **Active pipeline** — all non-terminal entries grouped by stage, most recently updated first
   - **Needs attention** — entries where the Next Action is overdue or blank
   - **Summary stats** — count per stage, total active
   - **Archived** — count of terminal entries (Accepted/Rejected/Withdrawn), collapsed

### Command: `add <company> <role> [url]`

1. Read `data/job-pipeline.md`.
2. Check for duplicates — if the company already exists in the active pipeline, warn the user and ask if they want to add a second role or update the existing one.
3. Add a new row to the pipeline table:
   - **Company**: from argument
   - **Role**: from argument
   - **Stage**: `Researching`
   - **Date Updated**: today's date (YYYY-MM-DD)
   - **Next Action**: auto-generated (see Stage Actions below)
   - **CV Used**: `—`
   - **Notes**: `—`
   - **URL**: from argument, or `—` if not provided
4. Write updated file.
5. Display the new entry and its auto-generated action items.
6. **Cross-reference**: Check if this company/role appears in `.claude/skills/scan-jobs/cache.md` — if found, mention the fit score from the scan.

### Command: `update <company> <new-stage>`

1. Read `data/job-pipeline.md`.
2. Find the matching company (case-insensitive, fuzzy). If multiple roles exist for the same company, ask which one.
3. Validate the stage transition is reasonable (warn but allow non-linear moves).
4. Update the row:
   - **Stage**: new stage
   - **Date Updated**: today's date
   - **Next Action**: auto-generated for the new stage (see Stage Actions below)
5. Write updated file.
6. Display the updated entry with stage-appropriate action items and any relevant coaching links.

### Command: `remove <company>`

1. Read `data/job-pipeline.md`.
2. Find the matching company. If multiple roles, ask which one.
3. Move the entry to the Archived section (set stage to `Withdrawn` if not already terminal).
4. Write updated file.
5. Confirm removal.
