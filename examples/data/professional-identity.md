# Professional Identity

How I see myself, my work, and my trajectory — distilled from personal coaching.
This is the inner truth that drives positioning, summaries, and interview presence.
Not for direct inclusion in resumes, but the foundation everything else is built on.

---

## Professional Identity

- I'm a platform builder, not just a DevOps engineer. I design the systems that let development teams ship faster and sleep better.
- My differentiator is bridging infrastructure and development — I write production code and design the platform it runs on.
- I think in systems, not services. When something breaks at 3am, I trace the problem across the whole stack, not just my slice.

## Strengths

- **Full-stack platform thinking:** I don't just set up CI/CD — I design the entire developer experience from commit to production, including observability and incident response.
- **Calm under pressure:** On-call for 5+ years across multiple platforms. I debug live incidents methodically, not frantically.
- **Bridge builder:** I translate between infrastructure concerns and product needs. Dev teams trust me because I understand their code; ops teams trust me because I understand their constraints.

## Growth Edges

- **Saying no to scope creep:** My systems-thinking strength means I see adjacent problems and want to fix them all. I take on too much.
- **Delegation:** I'm faster alone on most tasks, which makes me slow to hand off. I'm actively working on building team capability instead of just doing it myself.
- **Visibility:** I tend to let the work speak for itself. I'm learning that stakeholder communication is part of the job, not a distraction from it.

## Narrative Patterns

| Default framing | Reframe |
|---|---|
| "I set up the Kubernetes cluster" | "I designed and built the container platform that now runs 40+ microservices" |
| "I helped the team with their pipeline" | "I redesigned the CI/CD architecture, cutting deployment time from 45 minutes to 8" |
| "I did some monitoring work" | "I built the observability stack — Prometheus, Grafana, alerting — that reduced MTTR by 60%" |

## Work Style & Values

- **Deep work blocks:** I do my best work in 3-4 hour uninterrupted stretches. Meetings in the morning, building in the afternoon.
- **Written communication:** I prefer async, documented decisions over synchronous meetings.
- **Autonomy:** I need trust and space to work. Micromanagement is a dealbreaker.
- **Remote-first:** On-site for workshops and team building, remote for actual work.

## Career Direction

- Moving from pure implementation towards architecture and platform strategy
- Want to work with companies that take infrastructure seriously, not as an afterthought
- Interested in multi-cloud and hybrid scenarios — the real world isn't single-vendor
- Considering the AWS Solutions Architect Professional cert to complement the DevOps Professional

## Core Values (Hierarchy)

1. **Autonomy** — freedom to choose how I work and solve problems
2. **Craftsmanship** — doing things properly, not just fast
3. **Impact** — my work should measurably improve how teams ship software
4. **Learning** — every engagement should teach me something new
5. **Balance** — sustainable pace, not heroics
